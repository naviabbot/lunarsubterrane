##About  
Lunar Subterrane is a site that aims to go deeper than the typical fan site. With little to no backend politics, clean practices, and beautiful screenshots, LS strives to be the best 'little' fansite.

##Music  
The music featured on the site can be found on OverClocked ReMix and is used under their terms and service. All music is linked to the original download page for the user's listening enjoyment. All rights belong to the artists who spend their time devoting several hours remixing the music, OCReMix for hosting the music on their site, and to the original composer and publisher of the game, to which, we would not exist as fans. Domo Arigato and thank you to all involved
